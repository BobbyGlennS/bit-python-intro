    "We need to import some libraries if we want to do data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Libraries?*  \n",
    "Consider Python as a workbench that came with a few basic tools.\n",
    "You could build anything, but it would be hard work.\n",
    "Libraries are like lovingly crafted little kits with specific tools that allow you to create beautiful things on your workbench and significantly speed up your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you need to install libraries on your machine, but as we're using colab, the ones we need today come pre-installed.\n",
    "We only need to tell Python we want to use them - which is what we mean with 'importing'.\n",
    "To stick with the analogy: we already bought our special tools (the 'installation'), but we need to take them out of the storage cabinet to use them ('importing').\n",
    "We will cover installation of libraries in a separate session. \n",
    "R users will recognise the concept of libraries but might think of them as 'packages'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very commonly used library in data science is [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). \n",
    "It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.\n",
    "We will use it a lot in this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other libraries often used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- numpy helps with doing maths on colletions of numbers (like a matrix).\n",
    "- sci-kitlearn & statsmodels fit machine learning and statistical models.\n",
    "- matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly are libraries used for data viz.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this workshop we will at least need pandas and a specific module that comes with plotly, named graph_objects. \n",
    "We import them in the following cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put your cursor in the cell and pressing `ctrl+enter` will execute the cell."

You can include comments in your code by preceding them with a hash `#`. This tells Python to ignore this line when executing the code. It's handy when writing lots of code, or to tell an AI what type of code you want it to generate for you (more on that in another session).\n",
    "\n",
    "`df`    \n",
    "We don't just want to load the data, we will also need to tell python to store it somewhere. We are creating a variable named `df`. It will serve as a pointer to the data that we are about to load into the memory. This way python knows to keep hold of it, and let us bring it back up everytime we type `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`=`  \n",
    "We're telling python that this new variable should point to the result of the code that follows the equals sign (`=`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`pd.read_csv`  \n",
    "Use the function read_csv from the pandas library (which we said we would refer to as pd).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`('https://....')`  \n",
    "Between the parentheses we provide an 'argument'. It's an instruction to the function `read_csv()`. In this case the instruction is: 'go here to retrieve the file'. Note that we don't need to have the file on our laptop! You can point to any accessible location, including a file on your laptop but also, as is the caase here, to an online location.\n",

    "We will solve this problem by first adding a `streak_indicator` column, that will be a boolean (as above) that indicates when the winning player is the same as in the shifted `winner_name` column. Then we will negate this column so that `False` indicates that the `winner_name` is the same as the previous `winner_name`. We can now apply the `cumsxum` function and create a new streak indicator column whose entries will be numbers that increment by 1 everytime a new streak is started. \n",
